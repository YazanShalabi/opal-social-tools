The Social Media "Remixer"

What it does: You paste a long formal paragraph (like a press release). The tool breaks it down and outputs three distinct versions:

LinkedIn: Professional + bullet points.

Twitter/X: Short, punchy, under 280 chars + hashtags.

Instagram: Casual tone + emoji heavy.

Why it's cool: It automates channel-specific content creation in one step.
